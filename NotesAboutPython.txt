I used venv to create a virtual environment for my project

The command I used is :
python -m venv . (this creates a virtual environment in the ., that means in the current folder)

Then to activate the environment use:
.\Scripts\activate

This will run the activate.bat // note: in powershell i've seen on stackoverflow you have to run activate.ps1, so you dont run the .bat file

To test if you are in the virtual environment use the expression:
sys.prefix != sys.base_prefix



The idiom used at the end is put there so you can import the file without it actually executing
When you run the file as a script it gets the name __main__, but when you import it as a modul it will have its own name

Heard of this library called argparse for when you work with cli arguments (better than sys)
